        "readme": "# Aech CLI Translator\n\nEnterprise translation workflow that leverages the Aech runtime. The CLI wraps three agents (translate, back-translate, audit) and exposes a single `translate` command.\n\n## What this CLI does (for Agent Aech)\n\n- Accepts: Markdown source file path, target language code, optional Markdown context/termbase, output directory.\n- Produces (in `output_dir`):\n  - Translation: `<stem>_<lang>.md` (Markdown only; render to DOCX/PDF for users).\n  - QA report: `<stem>_translation_report.md` with:\n    - Overall Quality Assessment: Pass / Needs Review / Fail.\n    - Key discrepancies (meaning/tone/terminology).\n    - Recommendations (what to fix if not Pass).\n- Offline-friendly: operates on local files only.\n- Expected automation: after running, render DOCX/PDF from the Markdown outputs, attach/link those user-friendly files, and include a short QA summary in the response to the requester (email/DM/ticket). Make clear whether it Passed or needs review and call out any specific risks.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe CLI uses an explicit `translate` subcommand. Invoke it with the source Markdown path and the target language, plus an output directory. Example:\n\n```\naech-cli-translator translate docs/blog.md es --output-dir build/locale --context termbase.md\n```\n\n- Command: `translate`\n- First positional: the input Markdown path.\n- Second positional: the target language code (e.g., `es`, `fr`, `de`).\n- `--output-dir` is required; `--context` is optional.\nNote: `aech-cli-translator --help` is reserved for the installer and emits the JSON manifest. For human-friendly help, use `aech-cli-translator translate --help`.\n\n## Expected automation workflow (agent script)\n\n1. Run the CLI with the user’s source file, target language, optional context, and an output directory the user can access.\n2. Read the generated files:\n   - Translation: `<stem>_<lang>.md`.\n   - QA report: `<stem>_translation_report.md`.\n3. Respond to the requester (email/DM/ticket) and:\n   - Render and attach/link DOCX/PDF outputs (avoid raw Markdown unless requested).\n   - Summarize QA in 2-4 bullets: overall quality (Pass/Needs Review/Fail), notable discrepancies, and any recommendations.\n   - Call out any blockers (missing context file, unreadable source, etc.).\n\n## QA report format\n\nThe report is freeform Markdown generated by the QA agent. At minimum it should contain:\n- Overall Quality Assessment: Pass / Needs Review / Fail.\n- Key discrepancies: meaning, tone, terminology issues found via back-translation.\n- Recommendations: what to adjust in the translation.\n",
